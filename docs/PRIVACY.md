# Privacy Policy

*Last Updated: August 2025*
*This policy explains exactly what data we (don‚Äôt) collect, why, and how you stay in control.*
See also: **[Security Policy](./SECURITY.md)** for threat model and infrastructure controls.

## üéØ Our Privacy Commitment

At DHK Align, **privacy is not a feature, it's our foundation**. We built this service specifically for users who value their privacy above convenience.

### Privacy-First Principles

1. **Free‚Äëfirst local processing**: Core transliteration runs in your browser. Free requests may call the private backend for availability/rate‚Äëlimit checks; content is not stored.
2. **Minimal Collection**: We only collect what's absolutely necessary
3. **User Control**: You decide what to share with us
4. **Full Transparency**: Our code is open source and auditable
5. **No Surveillance**: We don't track or profile users
6. **No Data Sales**: We'll never sell your data to anyone
7. **Right to Forget**: Full delete-on-demand capability

## üìä Information We Collect

### What We DON'T Collect (By Default)

- ‚ùå **Translation content**: Your text never leaves your device
- ‚ùå **Device identifiers**: No fingerprinting
- ‚ùå **Browser details**: No user agent logging
- ‚ùå **Location data**: No geolocation tracking
- ‚ùå **Third-party cookies**: No advertising trackers
- ‚ùå **Analytics pixels**: No behavior tracking
- ‚ùå **Social media widgets**: No external integrations
- ‚ùå **Session recordings**: No heatmaps, click tracking, or screen recording

### What We Collect (Minimal)

#### Security Events (All Tiers)
For abuse prevention and availability, the edge (Cloudflare Worker) and the private backend write **tamper‚Äëevident security audit logs**:
- **What**: event type (e.g., bad request, rate‚Äëlimited, auth fail), **IP address**, timestamp, route.
- **What not**: **no translation text**, **no user identifiers**.
- **Where**: local only, in `private/audit/security.jsonl` (HMAC‚Äësigned, append‚Äëonly).
- **Retention**: up to **90 days**, then rotated; kept offline unless needed for security investigations.

#### Free Tier Users (Default)
- **No translation content collected; security events as described above**
- **Usage counter**: Stored locally in your browser only
- **Preferences**: Theme and language settings (local storage)
- **Cache**: Recent translations (for speed, stored locally)
- **Error logs**: Only in your browser console, never uploaded

#### Pro/Lifetime Users (Optional Account)
If you choose to create an account for Pro features:

If you submit feedback to improve translations:

| Data Type | Purpose | Storage | Retention |
|-----------|---------|---------|-----------|
| **Original phrase** | Translation improvement | Encrypted database | 5 years (manual review + improvement) |
| **Suggested translation** | Quality enhancement | Encrypted database | 5 years (manual review + improvement) |
| **Feedback rating** | Performance metrics | Anonymous aggregation | 5 years (manual review + improvement) |
