# Privacy Policy

*Last Updated: September 2025*
*This policy explains exactly what data we (don‚Äôt) collect, why, and how you stay in control.*
See also: **[Security Policy](./SECURITY.md)** for threat model and infrastructure controls.

## üéØ Our Privacy Commitment

At DHK Align, **privacy is not a feature, it's our foundation**. We built this service specifically for users who value their privacy above convenience.

> **Note:** When you use DHK Align from certain regions, your requests may be processed on an edge server (such as a Cloudflare Worker) for speed and availability. Edge processing follows the same privacy guarantees: transliteration content is not stored, only minimal, short-lived metadata (e.g., rate-limit counters) may be cached briefly at the edge for performance and abuse prevention. No content or identifiers are persisted in edge storage.

### Privacy-First Principles

1. **Free‚Äëfirst local processing**: Core transliteration runs in your browser. Free-tier users' text is processed locally whenever possible. Free requests may call the private backend or edge for availability/rate‚Äëlimit checks, but transliteration content is never stored or persisted.
2. **Minimal Collection**: We only collect what's absolutely necessary
3. **User Control**: You decide what to share with us
4. **Full Transparency**: Our code is open source and auditable
5. **No Surveillance**: We don't track or profile users
6. **No Data Sales**: We'll never sell your data to anyone
7. **Right to Forget**: Full delete-on-demand capability
8. **Short-lived edge cache**: Any edge cache (for rate-limiting or availability) is short-lived and contains no transliteration content or user identifiers.

## üìä Information We Collect

### What We DON'T Collect (By Default)

- ‚ùå **Transliteration content**: Your text never leaves your device (for free users; pro users also protected‚Äîsee below)
- ‚ùå **Persistent device identifiers**: No fingerprinting, no unique device IDs stored
- ‚ùå **Browser details**: No user agent logging
- ‚ùå **Location data**: No geolocation tracking
- ‚ùå **Third-party cookies**: No advertising trackers
- ‚ùå **Analytics pixels**: No behavior tracking
- ‚ùå **Social media widgets**: No external integrations
- ‚ùå **Session recordings**: No heatmaps, click tracking, or screen recording

### What We Collect (Minimal)

#### Security Events (All Tiers)
For abuse prevention and availability, the edge (Cloudflare Worker) and the private backend write **tamper‚Äëevident security audit logs**:
- **What**: event type (e.g., bad request, rate‚Äëlimited, auth fail), **IP address**, timestamp, and route accessed (not content).
- **What not**: **no translation text**, **no user identifiers**.
- **Where**: local only, in `private/audit/security.jsonl` (HMAC‚Äësigned, append‚Äëonly).
- **Retention**: up to **90 days**, then rotated; kept offline unless needed for security investigations.
- **Note**: Edge KV (key-value) storage is **not** used for audit logs or persistent event storage; logs are kept local and short-lived.

#### Free Tier Users (Default)
- **No translation content collected; security events as described above**
- **Usage counter**: Stored locally in your browser only
- **Preferences**: Theme and language settings (local storage)
- **Cache**: Recent translations (for speed, stored locally)
- **Error logs**: Only in your browser console, never uploaded
- **Edge cache**: No translation content or user identifiers are stored in edge cache; only short-lived counters for rate limiting.

#### Pro/Lifetime Users (Optional Account)
If you choose to create an account for Pro features:

| Data Type | Purpose | Storage | Retention |
|-----------|---------|---------|-----------|
| **Email address** | Login, password reset, support communication | Encrypted database | While account is active + 30 days |
| **Payment reference** | Subscription management | Tokenized via Stripe/BTCPay | 7 years (legal requirement) |

| **API key (if used)** | Authenticate API requests | Encrypted database | While active + 30 days |

**Note:** Input text for transliteration is **not stored** on the server‚Äîneither as history nor in logs.

#### Optional Analytics (Disabled by Default)
Analytics are **off by default** and require explicit opt-in in Settings. We do not use any third-party analytics.
If you explicitly enable analytics in settings:

| Data Type | Purpose | Processing | Retention |
|-----------|---------|------------|-----------|

| **Transliterator-tion confidence score** | Quality improvement | Statistical analysis | 90 days |
| **Processing time** | Performance optimization | Anonymous metrics | 90 days |
| **Success/failure rate** | Error reduction | Anonymous statistics | 90 days |

#### Optional Feedback (User-Initiated)
If you submit feedback to improve translations:

| Data Type | Purpose | Storage | Retention |
|-----------|---------|---------|-----------|
| **Original phrase** | Translation improvement | Encrypted database | 5 years (manual review + improvement) |
| **Suggested translation** | Quality enhancement | Encrypted database | 5 years (manual review + improvement) |
| **Feedback rating** | Performance metrics | Anonymous aggregation | 5 years (manual review + improvement) |

# DHK Align ‚Äî Privacy Notice

**Effective date:** 2025‚Äë09‚Äë22

This Privacy Notice explains what we collect, how we use it, and the choices you have when using DHK Align‚Äôs translation services (the ‚ÄúService‚Äù). We design the stack to minimize data collection and keep the origin private behind an edge gateway.

---

## Quick summary (plain language)
- We **do not sell** your data.
- We **do not** store translation text by default.
- Payment is handled by **Stripe**; we never see card numbers.
- For paid users, we mint an **API key** and keep minimal metadata to operate the Service.
- Clients talk to the **Edge Worker**; the Worker calls the origin with an **internal** header (`x‚Äëedge‚Äëshield`). Clients never send this header.

---

## What we collect

### 1) Service telemetry (required to run the Service)
- **Usage counters** (KV): per‚ÄëAPI‚Äëkey daily counts (e.g., `usage:<key>:YYYY‚ÄëMM‚ÄëDD`).
- **Cache metadata**: whether a request was a cache **HIT/MISS** at the edge and/or origin.
- **Timestamps** and **route** names (e.g., `/translate`, `/translate/pro`).
- **Administrative events**: key created/checked/deleted via admin routes (no plaintext key returned except at issuance).

> If origin IP rate‚Äëlimits (SlowAPI) are enabled, the origin briefly evaluates IPs solely to enforce limits; we avoid persisting IPs longer than necessary for that purpose.

### 2) Billing (only for paid users)
- **Stripe events** for checkout and key issuance: event id, timestamp, status.
- **Email** (if provided by Stripe) ‚Äî used to associate a plan with your API key and for receipts/support.
- **API key metadata**: plan, issuedAt, eventId, optional email.

> We do **not** process card numbers. Card data never touches our servers.

### 3) Client‚Äëside storage
- **LocalStorage** may store your **API key** on your device so the client can call the edge. You can clear it at any time.

### 4) Optional logs
- For debugging, we may enable short‚Äëlived origin logs (status codes, timing). We avoid logging full translation text. Security/audit logs may include admin actions and key issuance.

---

## What we do **not** collect by default
- No behavioral analytics beacons on product pages.
- No microphone/camera recording or precise geolocation.
- No account is required for the free tier.

---

## How we use the data
- **Operate the Service**: authenticate requests, enforce quotas/rate‚Äëlimits, translate, and serve cached results.
- **Billing**: process Stripe webhooks to mint/activate API keys upon successful checkout.
- **Security**: detect abuse (quota exceedance, replay attempts, invalid signatures), and protect the origin.
- **Support**: respond to user inquiries and troubleshoot issues.

### Legal bases (GDPR)
- **Contract** (Art. 6(1)(b)): providing the Service you request; generating an API key after payment.
- **Legitimate interests** (Art. 6(1)(f)): abuse prevention, security, and reliability.
- **Consent** (Art. 6(1)(a)): only if we introduce optional cookies/analytics in the future (none by default).

---

## Data retention
- **Edge usage counters (KV)**: rolling **30‚Äì35 days** (per‚Äëday keys expire automatically).
- **`session_to_key:<sessionId>` mapping**: **7 days** TTL; deleted on first successful read of `/billing/key`.
- **Stripe event replay locks**: **90 days**.
- **API key enable flags** (`apikey:<key>` = "1") and metadata (`apikey.meta:<key>`): retained until deactivation.
- **Origin request logs** (if enabled): target **‚â§ 30 days**.
- **Security/audit logs**: up to **180 days** for integrity and incident response.
- **Backups**: via scripts (`scripts/backup_db.sh` / `scripts/restore.sh`); encrypted snapshots may be kept according to business continuity needs.

We prefer shorter retention where feasible and adjust within these windows as we tune operations.

---

## Data sharing and processors
- **Cloudflare** (Workers, KV, CDN) ‚Äî edge execution, caching, and transport security.
- **Stripe** ‚Äî payments and checkout webhooks. We receive event ids and limited metadata; cards never touch us.
- **Email provider** ‚Äî for support/receipts if you contact us.

We do not permit our processors to use your data for their own marketing.

---

## Security measures (summary)
- **Private origin** behind a Worker; internal shield header (`x‚Äëedge‚Äëshield`) added by the edge.
- **API key** required for paid route; **admin key** required for admin endpoints.
- **Daily per‚Äëkey quotas** at the edge; optional IP rate‚Äëlimits at origin.
- **CORS allowlist** and strict **CSP** (prod) with Stripe host allowed; dev origins listed separately.
- **Replay protection** for Stripe (timestamp tolerance + KV dedupe).
- **Least data**: we minimize logs and avoid storing full text content.

> See `docs/SECURITY.md` for the full threat model and headers.

---

## International transfers
We operate with **Cloudflare Workers/KV**, which may process data in multiple regions. We limit what we store and use standard contractual protections where applicable.

---

## Your rights
Depending on your location, you may have rights to access, correct, delete, or receive a copy of your data, and to object to or restrict certain processing.

- **Access/Deletion**: email us from the address associated with your Stripe receipt or include your API key: `admin@dhkalign.com`.
- **Portability**: we can export your API key metadata and usage counts tied to your key.
- **Opt‚Äëout of marketing**: we do not send marketing by default; if this changes, you‚Äôll have an opt‚Äëout.

We may need to verify your identity (e.g., via email receipt or API key ownership) before fulfilling requests.

---

## Cookies and local storage
- We do not set marketing cookies.
- The client may store your **API key** in **localStorage** so the UI can call the edge; remove it in your browser settings to sign out.

---

## Children
The Service is not directed to children under 13 (or under 16 in the EU). Do not use the Service if you are below the applicable age of digital consent.

---

## Changes to this notice
If we make material changes, we will update this page and adjust the effective date. For significant changes (e.g., adding analytics), we will provide reasonable advance notice in‚Äëproduct.
