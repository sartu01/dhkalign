## üöÄ Getting Started

### ‚è±Ô∏è 10-Minute Quickstart (Frontend-only)

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
cp .env.example .env
npm start   # http://localhost:3000
```

This is the fastest way to contribute. Most contributions start with the React app.

> **Public vs Private**  
> Do not commit datasets, engine weights, or private .env files.  
> Only commit frontend code, docs, and public backend notes.

### 1. Fork & Clone

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub, then:
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/dhkalign.git
cd dhkalign

# Add upstream remote for syncing (official repo)
git remote add upstream https://github.com/sartu01/dhkalign.git

# Verify remotes
git remote -v
```

### 2. Development Setup

#### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.19.x (see .nvmrc)
- Python 3.10.12 (see pyproject.toml)
- Git 2.40+
- macOS/Linux/WSL recommended

#### Frontend Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
cd frontend
npm install

# Lint code
npm run lint

# Copy environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Start development server
npm start
```

Visit http://localhost:3000 to see your changes.

#### Backend Development (Optional)

```bash
# Setup Python environment
cd backend
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .\.venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt  # or requirements.private.txt if using private features

# Copy environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Start development server
python main.py
```

Visit http://localhost:8000/docs for API documentation.

#### Optional: Docker Dev

```bash
# Start only the public backend (if needed for feedback/health)
docker compose -f docker-compose.public.yml up -d backend
```

### 3. Create a Branch

```bash
# Update your main branch
git checkout main
git pull upstream main

# Create a new branch for your contribution
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# Examples:
# - feature/voice-input
# - fix/translation-accuracy
# - docs/setup-instructions
# - ui/mobile-improvements
```

## üìù Making Changes

**General Rules**
- Do not commit secrets, API keys, or datasets
- Do not log or upload raw user input; anonymize at source
- Keep translations client-side; backend must remain optional
- Follow performance budgets: <50ms cached translate, bundle ~150KB
- Update docs when behavior/flags change

### Adding Translations

Use lowercase keys, include common variants, and keep values in simple, clear English.

The most impactful way to contribute! Edit the translation data:

```json
// frontend/src/utils/dhk_align_data_client.json
{
  "t": {
    // Add your translations here
    "apni kemon achen": "how are you (formal)",
    "tomar bari kothay": "where is your home",
    "ami thik achi": "i am okay",
    "onek dhonnobad": "thank you very much"
  }
}
```

#### JSON Schema for Translation Entries

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "patternProperties": {
    "^[a-z0-9\\s]+$": { "type": "string" }
  },
  "additionalProperties": false
}
```

*Keys must be lowercase Banglish, values must be simple English.*

#### Translation Guidelines

1. **Use lowercase** for Banglish phrases
2. **Include variations** (formal/informal, regional)
3. **Preserve cultural context** in comments
4. **Test thoroughly** with the translation engine
5. **Add common phrases** that people actually use
6. **Consider phonetic variations** (different spellings)
7. **No personally identifiable information** in examples
8. **Run 'npm test'** to ensure data shape/JSON validity
9. **Romanization**: Use standard Banglish rules (a=‡¶Ü, o=‡¶Ö, ee=‡¶á/‡¶à, oo=‡¶â, etc.) ‚Äî accepted variants: kemon/kamne, bhalo/valo.

‚ö†Ô∏è All contributed phrases must be original or permissibly licensed ‚Äî no scraping from proprietary sources.

#### Examples of Good Translations

```json
{
  // Common greetings
  "salam": "hello (islamic greeting)",
  "namaskar": "hello (hindu greeting)", 
  "adab": "hello (formal/respectful)",
  
  // Regional variations
  "kemon achen": "how are you (standard)",
  "kemon acen": "how are you (sylheti)",
  "kemne acen": "how are you (chittagong)",
  
  // Cultural context
  "eid mubarak": "blessed eid (islamic festival greeting)",
  "poila boishakh": "bengali new year",
  "durga puja": "durga puja (hindu festival)"
}
```

### Code Style Guidelines

Use ESLint + Prettier for React; use black + flake8 + mypy for Python.

#### JavaScript/React

```javascript
// Uses React hooks; no side effects in render
// ‚úÖ Good: Clear, functional, well-documented
export const TranslationResult = ({ text, confidence, method }) => {
  const confidenceColor = useMemo(() => {
    if (confidence > 0.9) return 'text-green-600';
    if (confidence > 0.7) return 'text-yellow-600';
    return 'text-orange-600';
  }, [confidence]);

  return (
    <div className="translation-result bg-white rounded-lg shadow-sm p-4">
      <p className="text-lg font-medium text-gray-900">{text}</p>
      <div className="mt-2 flex items-center justify-between">
        <span className={`text-sm font-medium ${confidenceColor}`}>
          {Math.round(confidence * 100)}% confident
        </span>
        <span className="text-xs text-gray-500 bg-gray-100 px-2 py-1 rounded">
          {method}
        </span>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
```

#### Python (Backend)

```python
# ‚úÖ Good: Typed, documented, clear error handling
from typing import Dict, Optional, List, Any
from fastapi import HTTPException
from pydantic import BaseModel, validator

class TranslationRequest(BaseModel):
    text: str
    session_id: Optional[str] = None
    
    @validator('text')
    def validate_text(cls, v):
        if not v or len(v.strip()) == 0:
            raise ValueError('Text cannot be empty')
        if len(v) > 200:
            raise ValueError('Text too long (max 200 characters)')
        return v.strip()

async def process_translation(
    request: TranslationRequest
) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Process a translation request with comprehensive error handling.
    
    Args:
        request: Translation request with text and optional session ID
        
    Returns:
        Dictionary containing translation result and metadata
        
    Raises:
        HTTPException: If translation fails or input is invalid
    """
    try:
        # Process translation
        result = await translation_engine.translate(request.text)
        
        if not result:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=422, 
                detail="Unable to translate the provided text"
            )
        
        return {
            "translation": result.translation,
            "confidence": result.confidence,
            "method": result.method,
            "success": True
        }
        
    except Exception as e:
        logger.exception(f"Translation failed: {str(e)}")
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=500,
            detail="Translation service temporarily unavailable"
        )
```
